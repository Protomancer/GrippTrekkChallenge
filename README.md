# GrippTrekkChallenge

## Description

GrippTrekk Challenge is a simple app designed to help track progress in hiking and eventually bouldering.
Its set up to be easy to use and understand without all the other bells and whistles of modern training apps.
In the process of designing and building the app, we learned that there are a great deal of little stumbling blocks that can add up to things taking longer than one might assume to deliver a finished product.

## Installation
You can acess the file on github @ Protomancer/GripptrekkChallenge. once there you can copy the link info into your git and clone the repo. After you have cloned the repo go ahead and open the files in vsCode. Once in open ypur terminal and run [npm i] to install the required packages. Once installed you can start the server by inputting [npm run start] into the console command line. After that you can access the webpage via typing 
http://localhost:3001 into your browser. Now you can see the app and interact with it.

## Usage
To use the app you will need to do the following.
        -Head to the app page either from the git download or the heroku page
        -Create an account on the sign-up page
        -Once you have created an account you will be able to acess the Hike tracker(Boulder tracker incoming)
        -When you use the hike tracker you can give the name of the hike as well as the length,time to complete,elevation change and more to come.
        -When you save it you can return and try to improve your times and compare to previous attempts
        -When your all done you can save your info then log out.
